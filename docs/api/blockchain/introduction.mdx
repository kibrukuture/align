<Warning>
  **Important Note**: The Blockchain module is an addition to the Align SDK and
  is not part of the core AlignLab API. These utilities are provided to simplify
  blockchain interactions (wallets, transactions, smart contracts) alongside
  your Align integration.
</Warning>

## Overview

The Blockchain module provides a set of tools to interact directly with supported blockchain networks. While Align handles the fiat-to-crypto and cross-chain logic, this module allows you to:

    Interact with any smart contract using standard ABIs.

## Getting Started

To use the blockchain module, you don't need any additional configuration if you've already initialized the `Align` client. The blockchain resources are available under the `blockchain` property.

```typescript
import Align from "@tolbel/align";

const align = new Align({
  apiKey: "your_api_key",
  environment: "sandbox",
});

// Access blockchain features
const balance = await align.blockchain.wallets.getBalance("0x...");
```

## Features

- **Wallet Management**: Create random wallets, import from mnemonics or private keys, and encrypt/decrypt local wallets.
- **Smart Contracts**: Full support for reading, writing, and listening to events on generic smart contracts.
- **Token Utilities**: Fetch token info, format/parse amounts, and manage ERC-20 tokens.
- **Provider Access**: Use Align's default RPCs or configure your own custom providers for specialized needs.
